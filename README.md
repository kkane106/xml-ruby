### Simple XML parser using REXML

Just dug into XML in the context of Java/Spring MVC and wanted to get some practical parsing experience under my belt. Used the REXML class available in the Ruby library, initially was going to use a gem, but decided to reduce dependencies to be as hands on as possible

...subsequently decided to throw it into a sinatra skeleton. Use the XML parser I built to save my faked xml data to the databse
